Problem Statement
Given N vertical poles a1, a2, ..., aN having corresponding heights a[1], a[2], ..., a[N] and width 1 unit. In one step, you can either remove one pole or reduce heights of each poles by 1. If a pole has height 0, it can't be reduced further. Find the minimum number of steps, to reduce all poles to 0 height.

constraints:
1 <= N <= 1e5
0 <= a[i] <= 1e4

 

Input Format
First line contains integer N
Next line contains N integers, i'th of it denoting values of a[i]

 

Output Format
Print a single line denoting the minimum number of steps required
